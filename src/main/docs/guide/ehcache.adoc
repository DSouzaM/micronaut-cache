To use https://www.ehcache.org/[Ehcache] as the caching implementation, add it as a dependency to your application:

dependency:org.ehcache:ehcache:{ehcacheVersion}[]

To have Micronaut create a cache, the minimum configuration is:

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  caches:
    my-cache:
      enabled: true
----

Then, you can use any of the caching annotations with `my-cache` as cache name.

The full list of configuration options is:
