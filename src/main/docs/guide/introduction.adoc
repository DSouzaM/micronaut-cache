This project brings cache support to Micronaut.

To get started, you need to declare the following dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.cache:micronaut-cache-core:{version}[]

Note that this configuration module requires at least Micronaut 1.3. Since this version, caching support has been
extracted out from core into this configuration library.

To use the `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` version of this library, check the
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#usingsnapshots[documentation to use snapshots].
